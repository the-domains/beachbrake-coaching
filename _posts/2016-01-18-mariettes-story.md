Mariette's Story...

If you were a fly on my wall a few years ago, you would have seen me in my mid-thirties, having fun, making up songs, playing and being silly with my two young kids. You might have seen me as a wife enjoying a real and comfortable conversation with my husband. Or you might even have seen me with a good book in hand loving my time alone.

Now imagine you were a fly watching me somewhere out in the real world. I was still smiling and very agreeable but if you looked close (really close), things didn't look quite the same. The silliness wasn't there. Neither was my relaxed way of communicating with those around me. Some might have noticed an ever-changing me in response to each new person or situation that came my way.

You see, I once thought I wasn't good enough. I needed to be more, do more, try harder, be someone other than who I was when only my family was watching. I forgot how to be me and focused on everything I wasn't.

The time came though, when I was too exhausted and disheartened to play the many roles I had unsuccessfully tried to play. After illness forced me to take a break from my teaching career, I started asking myself some difficult questions and I finally started to listen to the answers.

Today I have learned to accept and love myself, flaws and all. This has been an amazing and life-changing discovery. If you are ready to claim your life, I am here to help!
