You're probably interested in coaching because you've found 
yourself at a crossroads of some kind -- either by choice or by 
circumstance -- which is leading to a desire to change. Or maybe you are 
just dissatisfied with your life and are looking for a new approach.

Life coaching works because it is a partnership that involves 
powerful questioning, tools and exercises to help you gain clarity, get 
unstuck and find joy in your life.

I have the benefit of an outsider's view of your life and can more 
clearly see your blind spots and unhelpful patterns. I help you get past
these limitations. I also help you to clarify what you really want, and
I continually remind you of this vision when fear and doubt get in the 
way.

The type of work I do, and the tools I use depend on where you are in
your cycle of change. The model of change and many of the tools I use 
are based on the work of [Martha Beck][0]
. Martha is a well-known life coach, author and columnist for O 
Magazine. She has been training coaches for several years in a style of 
coaching that combines Eastern Philosophy and Western science with the 
purpose of helping people get back to their essence and then from this 
place of clarity, create a life that satisfies their soul.

No matter what stage of the cycle of change you're in, there will 
always be fears that come up, and limiting thoughts that need to be 
dissolved. I will teach you several tools to help you deal with these 
obstacles.

The best way to fully understand how coaching works and how you can
