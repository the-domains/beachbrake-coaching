Are you ready to choose to take a rest stop where you give yourself the space and time to hear what it is this next part of your journey looks like?

Put the brakes on and take a virtual Mexican holiday (and if you want ending it with the a celebration retreat here in Sayulita) where the warmth, the ocean, the sand, the beauty and the "you time" provide the space to listen, learn and be aligned with: 

- what it looks like to put peace, love and fulfillment as the purpose of your journey

- what it looks like to be the driver in your journey, making decision based on what you are pulled to do rather than what you think you should do or have to do

- what it looks like to be guided by your inner wisdom that always has your back

- what your unique signs and red flags are and what they mean 

- how not to be pulled off course by others on this journey but instead invite them in as guides helping you to connect to your own growth and as a way to give and receive of your love, time and support
